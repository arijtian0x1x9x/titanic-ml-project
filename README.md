## 🚀 Overview

This project builds a machine learning system to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster.  
It demonstrates a complete end-to-end ML workflow including:

- Data preprocessing  
- Feature engineering  
- Model training (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)  
- Out-of-Fold (OOF) blending ensemble  
- Cross-validation  
- Kaggle submission generation  
- Model saving for deployment  

🎯 **Final Cross-Validated Accuracy:** **0.8373**  
🎯 **Best Kaggle Public LB:** **0.77751 (Random Forest)**
